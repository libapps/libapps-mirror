# libdot

This is a small set of custom JS utility libraries initially developed as part
of hterm, now available as shared code.  It provides a base layer for web
applications.  The code is intended to work in any modern browser, in either a
plain web page or a "privileged" environment such as a Chrome platform
application or Firefox extension.  In practice, it's only been put to use in
Chrome extensions/platform applications so far.

Overtime we'll probably convert these to newer JS standards, or replace with
more common npm libraries.
