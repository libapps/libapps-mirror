# Introduction

If you need to dive into the hterm internals, these are the docs for you.

If you just want to use hterm in your project, then you don't need this.
Check out the [hacking](../hack.md) & [embedding](../embed.md) docs instead.

If you're a user interacting with hterm, but not actually writing a program
using hterm, then these definitely don't want these docs :).

## Chapters

Here are the various internals topics.

* [Source Layout](./source.md): The meaning of each piece of the source tree.
* [Life Cycle](./lifecycle.md): General overview of the lifetime of hterm.
