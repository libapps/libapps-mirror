```

[TOC]

# Introduction

Secure Shell is a Chrome extension that combines hterm with a NaCl build of
OpenSSH to provide a PuTTY-like app for Chrome users.

See [/HACK.md](/HACK.md) for general information about working with the source
control setup.

# Building the dependencies

The Secure Shell app depends on some library code from
[libapps/libdot/](/libdot/) and the hterm terminal emulator from in
[libapps/hterm/](/hterm/).  To build these external dependencies, run...

    nassh$ ./bin/mkdeps

This will create the `nassh/js/nassh_deps.concat.js` file containing all of the
necessary libdot and hterm source.

## The NaCl plugin dependency

Secure Shell depends on a NaCl (Native Client) plugin to function.  This plugin
is a port of OpenSSH.  You'll have to find or create a version of this plugin,
and copy it into `libapps/nassh/plugin/`.

Your options are (pick one):

1. Build it yourself from [ssh_client].  This can take some time, but once it's
finished:
```
# In the ssh_client/ directory.
$ cp -a output/hterm/plugin/ ../nassh/
```

2. Grab an existing release.  For example:
```
# In the nassh/ directory.
$ wget https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromeos-localmirror/secureshell/releases/0.27.tar.xz
$ tar -xvf 0.27.tar.xz plugin/
```

3. Copy the `plugin/` directory from the latest version of Secure Shell.
If you have Secure Shell installed, the plugin can be found in your profile
directory, under
`Default/Extensions/iodihamcpbpeioajjeobimgagajmlibd/<version>/plugin/`.

# Dev-Test cycle

## Loading Unpacked Extensions

Loading directly from the checked out nassh directory is the normal way of
testing.  It will use the dev extension id to avoid conflicts with the stable
extension id, although it will still conflict if you have the dev version
installed from the Chrome Web Store (CWS).

The extension id is controlled by the `key` field in the manifest.json.  See
the [manifest key docs](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest/key)
for more details.

### Adding To Chrome

Now that your checkout is ready, you can load it into Chrome.

1. Navigate to the `chrome://extensions` page.
2. Turn on *Developer Mode* (look for the toggle in the upper right or bottom
   right of the page depending on Chrome version).
3. Click *Load Unpacked Extension* and navigate to the `nassh/` directory.

If you're not running on Chrome OS device, and loading the app, you might see
warnings right away about certain permissions (see the whitelisted sections
below).  You can ignore those.  It's unfortunate they show up with the same
level/color as legitmate errors.
```
* 'file_system_provider_capabilities' is only allowed for extensions and packaged apps, but this is a legacy packaged app.
* 'terminalPrivate' is not allowed for specified platform.
* 'fileSystemProvider' is not allowed for specified platform.
```

## Manifests

If you're updating the [manifest.json], you'll sometimes also need to update the
[manifest][manifest_crosh.json] for [crosh] which lives in the Chromium tree.

## Whitelisted Permissions

Using the dev extension id is necessary in order to access some APIs that are
whitelisted only for Secure Shell.  If you don't need these features, you can
get by with using a different id (and delete the settings from the
[manifest.json] to avoid warnings at runtime).

* Access to [crosh] under Chrome OS (`terminalPrivate`).
  [(1)](https://cs.chromium.org/search/?q=terminalPrivate)
  [(2)](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/common/extensions/api/terminal_private.json)
  [(3)](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/browser/extensions/api/terminal/terminal_extension_helper.cc)
* Access to raw sockets under NaCl.  This allows connecting directly to SSH
  servers (e.g. port 22).
  [(1)](https://cs.chromium.org/search/?q=kPredefinedAllowedSocketOrigins)
  <br>
  Note: Making connections over https using relay servers will still work
  though.  See the [FAQ] for more details.
* Access to [chrome.sockets] APIs.  This allows connecting directly to SSH
  servers (e.g. port 22).  We're allowing this pending [Native Sockets] support
  in the web platform itself.
* Access to `chrome.crashReportPrivate` APIs.
  This allows users to opt-in to providing crash-reports.
  Not required to be able to use Secure Shell of course.
* Access to `chrome.metricsPrivate` APIs.
  This allows users to opt-in to metrics/UMA collection about basic features.
  Not required to be able to use Secure Shell of course.
* SFTP backend for Chrome OS (`fileSystemProvider` and
  `file_system_provider_capabilities`).
  [(1)](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/common/extensions/api/_permission_features.json)
  <br>
  Note: Normal extensions/apps can use these features, but since Secure Shell
  is still a "legacy packaged app", we had to whitelist access.

To double check what & where things are whitelisted, search the Chromium code
base for our extension ids:

| Name             | ID                                    | hash                                          |

The hashes are the SHA1's of the (lower case) extension id.
```sh
$ ext_id_hash() { printf "$1" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sha1sum | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'; }

## Partner Extensions

There are a few extensions we talk to for various services at runtime which need
to whitelist our extension ids (for source verification).  If you don't need any
of these services, then you can ignore it.

* [gnubbyd app beknehfpfkghjoafdifaflglpjkojoco](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/beknehfpfkghjoafdifaflglpjkojoco)
  * Optional SSH Agent backend (mostly for internal Google use).
  * See http://cl/180966847 as an example.
* [gnubbyd extension lkjlajklkdhaneeelolkfgbpikkgnkpk](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lkjlajklkdhaneeelolkfgbpikkgnkpk)
  * Same as above.
* [Smart Card Connector khpfeaanjngmcnplbdlpegiifgpfgdco](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/khpfeaanjngmcnplbdlpegiifgpfgdco)
  * Optional SSH Agent backend built for [hardware keys](./hardware-keys.md).
  * See https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/chromeos_smart_card_connector/pull/54 as an example.

## Stable Extension

If you try to load an unpacked extension using the stable extension id, you
might run into problems if your administrator installs it via enterprise
policy.  If you see the error below, you won't be able to bypass it.  Just
use the dev extension id instead.
```
Secure Shell (extension ID "pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo") is blocked by the administrator.
```

## Crosh

While most of the UI code for [crosh] lives here (e.g. HTML/CSS/JS), the backend
code and manifest lives in Chrome.

* [chrome/common/extensions/api/](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/common/extensions/api/):
  * [terminal_private.json](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/common/extensions/api/terminal_private.json):
    Defines the `chrome.terminalPrivate` JavaScript API.
* [chrome/browser/extensions/api/terminal/](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/browser/extensions/api/terminal/):
  Implements the `chrome.terminalPrivate` JavaScript API.

# NaCl/JS Life cycle

When the extension is launched (e.g. a new connection is opened), the background
page is automatically created.  This is used to monitor global state like
extension updates and coordinate SFTP mounts.  The logic lives in
[nassh_background.js] and takes care of creating a new instance of `nassh.App`
which it saves in the background page's `app` variable.  If you aren't looking
at the SFTP logic, you can probably ignore this code.

When the extension is run, a new [nassh.html] window is shown.  If no connection
info is provided via the URL, then an iframe is created to show
[nassh_connect_dialog.html].  Here the user manages their saved list of
connections and picks the one they want to connect to.  This logic is in
[nassh_connect_dialog.js].  Once the user makes a selection (either connecting
or mounting), a message is sent to [nassh_command_instance.js].  There the
connection dialog is closed, the NaCl plugin is loaded, and the streams are
connected to hterm.

## Exit Codes

Since the ssh program uses positive exit statuses, we tend to use -1 for
internal exit states in the JS code.
It doesn't matter too much as the exit values are purely for showing the user.

## JS->NaCl API

Here is the API that the JS code uses to communicate with the NaCl [ssh_client]
module.

The `nassh.CommandInstance.prototype.sendToPlugin_` function in
[nassh_command_instance.js] is used to package up and make all the calls.
Helper functions are also provided in that file to avoid a JS API to callers.

At the lowest level, we pass a dictionary to the plugin.  It has two fields,
both of which must be specified (even if `arguments` is just `[]`).

* `name`: The function we want to call (as a string).
* `arguments`: An array of arguments to the function.

The `name` field can be any one of:

| Function name        | Description                      | Arguments |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|-----------|
| `startSession`       | Start a new ssh connection!      | (object `session`) |
| `onOpenFile`         | Open a new file.                 | (int `fd`, bool `success`, bool `is_atty`) |
| `onOpenSocket`       | Open a new socket.               | (int `fd`, bool `success`, bool `is_atty`) |
| `onRead`             | Send new data to the plugin.     | (int `fd`, ArrayBuffer `data`) |
| `onWriteAcknowledge` | Tell plugin we've read data.     | (int `fd`, number `count`) |
| `onClose`            | Close an existing fd.            | (int `fd`) |
| `onReadReady`        | Notify plugin data is available. | (int `fd`, bool `result`) |
| `onResize`           | Notify terminal size changes.    | (int `width`, int `height`) |
| `onExitAcknowledge`  | Used to quit the plugin.         | () |
| `onReadPass`         | Return the entered password.     | (str `pass`) |

The session object currently has these members:

* str `username`: Username for accessing the remote system.
* str `host`: Hostname for accessing the remote system.
* int `port`: Port number for accessing the remote system.
* int `terminalWidth`: Initial width of the terminal window.
* int `terminalHeight`: Initial height of the terminal window.
* bool `useJsSocket`: Whether to use JS for network traffic.
* object `environment`: A key/value object of environment variables.
* array `arguments`: Extra command line options for ssh.
* int `writeWindow`: Size of the write window.
* str `authAgentAppID`: Extension id to use as the ssh-agent.
* str `subsystem`: Which subsystem to launch.

The `onWriteAcknowledge` `count` field tracks the total byte count sent for the
connection, not the `count` from the most recent `write` request.
It supports up to `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` bytes.

## NaCl->JS API

Here is the API that the NaCl [ssh_client] code uses to communicate with the
JS layers.

At the lowest level, we pass a dictionary to the JS code.  It has two fields,
both of which must be specified (even if `arguments` is just `[]`).

* `name`: The function we want to call (as a string).
* `arguments`: An array of arguments to the function.

The `name` field can be any one of:

| Function name | Description                       | Arguments |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|-----------|
| `openFile`    | Plugin wants to open a file.      | (int `fd`, str `path`, int `mode`) |
| `openSocket`  | Plugin wants to open a socket.    | (int `fd`, str `host`, int `port`) |
| `read`        | Plugin wants to read data.        | (int `fd`, int `count`) |
| `write`       | Plugin wants to write data.       | (int `fd`, ArrayBuffer `data`) |
| `close`       | Plugin wants to close an fd.      | (int `fd`) |
| `exit`        | The plugin is exiting.            | (int `code`) |
| `printLog`    | Send a string to `console.log`.   | (str `str`) |
| `readPass`    | Plugin wants to read secrets.     | (str `prompt`, int `max_bytes`, bool `echo`) |

# SFTP {#SFTP}

On Chrome OS, it is possible to mount remote paths via SFTP and the Files app.
We currently support [version 3][SFTPv3] of the protocol.
We don't support newer standards because the most popular implementation is
[OpenSSH]'s which only supports SFTPv3, and for the majority of Secure Shell
users, they only interact with [OpenSSH].

We could support newer versions, but they wouldn't be well tested, and not a
lot of people would even use it, and it's not like we'd see any performance
improvements (as our operations tend to be basic open/read/write/close).

## Extensions

We support a few optional extensions to improve behavior or performance.

### SSH_FXP_SYMLINK arguments

The [SFTPv3] protocol says the argument order should be linkpath then the
targetpath, but OpenSSH made a mistake and reversed the order.
They can't change the order without breaking existing clients or servers, so
they document it and leave it as-is.

We follow the [OpenSSH SFTP Protocol] here, as do many other clients.

[SFTPv6] noted this desync between implementations and the specification and
replaced the `SSH_FXP_SYMLINK` packet type with a new `SSH_FXP_LINK`.

### fsync@openssh.com (v1)

The [OpenSSH SFTP Protocol] defines a `fsync@openssh.com` extension which takes
an open handle and instructs the remote server to use the `fsync()` syscall.

We use this extension when the user has requested syncing after writes.

### hardlink@openssh.com (v1)

The [OpenSSH SFTP Protocol] defines a `hardlink@openssh.com` extension with
the same API as `SSH_FXP_SYMLINK`.

We use this extension when the user has requested hardlinks explicitly.

### posix-rename@openssh.com (v1)

The [OpenSSH SFTP Protocol] defines a `posix-rename@openssh.com` extension with
the same API as `SSH_FXP_RENAME`, but uses the simple `rename(2)` semantics on
the server.
Otherwise, the default rename operation can be a bit buggy/racy.

We use this extension when available, or fallback to `SSH_FXP_RENAME` if not.

### statvfs@openssh.com (v2)

The [OpenSSH SFTP Protocol] defines a `statvfs@openssh.com` extension which
returns the `struct statvfs` data from `statvfs()` syscall.

We use this extension when the user has requested filesystem statistics.

### copy-data

The [copy-data] extension is great for speeding up remote copies as it avoids
having to download data from one file and uploading to a different one.
