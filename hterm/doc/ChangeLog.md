# 1.53, 2015-02-26, Add 'alt-gr-mode' preference.

* Add a preference to select the preferred AltGr heuristic.  This replaces the
  change from 1.52, which prevented the use of Ctrl-Alt-... on all platforms.
  The new preference takes one of the following values:

    null: Autodetect based on navigator.locale:
          'en-us' => 'none', else => 'right-alt'
    'none': Disable any AltGr related munging.
    'ctrl-alt': Assume Ctrl+Alt means AltGr.
    'left-alt': Assume left Alt means AltGr.
    'right-alt': Assume right Alt means AltGr.

  The default value is null.  Autodection won't work in many cases, and the
  left-alt/right-alt tracking will have issues if the window loses focus
  while the alt key is down, but this may be the best we can do on the web.

# 1.52, 2015-02-18, Treat Ctrl-Alt as AltGr

* Assume that Ctrl-Alt-[Printable] means AltGr-[Printable].  After this change,
  we ignore the ctrl/alt modifiers when they appear in keydown, leaving it
  up to the browser to send the correct key code in the keypress event.  This
  fixes a longstanding issue with international keyboards where users could
  not type characters/symbols that required use of AltGr.

  We will still have trouble on the mac, which does not set Ctrl+Alt when
  AltGr is used.

  BUG=chromium:211925
* Fix for issue where cursor would dissappear at non-100% zoom levels.
* Prevent navigation via media keys.
* Capture fullscreen ESC.
* Fix mouse wheel scrolling in FF.

# 1.51, 2014-11-11, 24-bit ANSI color support.

* Change log update to reflect previous commits.

# 1.50, 2014-10-07, Allow missing clipboard id in OSC 52

* Tmux sends OSC 52 as "ESC ] 52 ; ; ... BEL", but we failed to recognize the
  sequence because we expect a "clipboard identifier" character between the
  two semicolons.  We toss out the clipboard identifier anyway, so making it
  optional makes tmux clipboard integration work.

# 1.49, 2014-10-06, Fix HOME/END under application cursor mode.

* Send OSC H/OSC F for HOME/END when in application cursor mode, rather than
  application keypad mode.

# 1.48, 2014-08-13, grab bag of fixes.

* Place ruler text inside a span to fix issues on Firefox.
* Improve zoom keyboard handling on Mac and Firefox.
* Fix "CSI u" sequence.
* Remove the height + 1 underscore hack.
* Add parser routine and set css class for vt_tiledata support.  Users will
  still need to add a custom stylesheet to see vt tiles.
* Allow double-click selections to start with "." or "~".
* Disable terminal cursor hiding when vt mouse tracking is enabled.
* If the terminal cursor is hidden because it's under the mouse cursor, restore
  the visibility when the terminal cursor moves.

# 1.47, 2014-07-28, Fix clear-selection-after-copy, fractional sizes

* Always restore the selection after a copy operation, if we can.
  The clearSelectionAfterCopy option shouldn't come in to play here.
  We should only be clearing the selection after a delay, which means
  we'll always need to restore after a copy.
* Chrome 38 returns fractional dimensions for nodes that were
  set to a fractional size, where previous versions did not.
  However, a node contained by such a node whose width is set to
  '100%' returns only the integer portion of the width.  This patch
  makes us round up rather than set a fractional terminal width, and
  adjusts the test to exepect this behavior.

# 1.46, 2014-07-24, Fix right-click paste issues.

* Version 1.44 introduced an issue with right-click paste where focusing the
  paste target would force the page to scroll 1000px past the end of the
  terminal.  Now we place the paste target within the visible bounds of the
  terminal, but nehind it in z-index.

# 1.45, 2014-07-22, Fix overlay position on Firefox.

* Add the trailing 'px' in the css top/left property.  Chrome is ok without it,
  but it's required on Firefox.

# 1.44, 2014-07-22, Add 'cursor-blink-cycle', bracketed paste, other fixes.

* Fix Firefox detection in hterm.ScrollPort..decorate.
* Implement bracketed paste, BUG=chromium:393622
* Fix flash on paste, BUG=chromium:390357, BUG=chromium:394568
* Fix hollow-cursor-after-paste issue, BUG=chromium:390357
* Fix reverse-wrap.
* Add a 'cursor-blink-cycle' preference which can be a number or a two-number
  array.  If two numbers are provided, the first is how long a blinking cursor
  should be on, the second is how long it should be off.  If a single number is
  given it's used for both on and off.  Anything else results in a fast
  blinking cursor.  BUG=chromium:366206
* Hide terminal cursor when mouse cursor is over it, BUG=chromium:365910

# 1.43, 2014-07-15, Implement reverse wraparound.

* Implement reverse wraparound, add a test.

# 1.42, 2014-06-25, Stop requesting notification permission.

* This code depended on a user action, but the preference observers aren't
  run in the context of an action.  For now, it's up to the embedder to request
  the permission in hterm's behalf.
* Use window.document.title (not this.document_.title) as the default
  notification text.

# 1.41, 2014-06-24, Lots of new preferences.

* Add 'clear-selection-after-copy' preference, defaults to true.  Set to false
  to turn off hterm's policy of clearing your current selection after copying.
* Add 'use-default-window-copy' preference, needed in some environments (open
  web, certain browsers) to make copy actually work.
* Add 'desktop-notification-bell' preference, to show a desktop notification
  when the terminal bell is rung.
* Add 'east-asian-ambiguous-as-two-column' preference, defaults to false.
  Set to true to treat characters of ambiguous width as two columns wide.
* Implement italic character attributes.  "CSI [ 3 m" to enable, "CSI [ 23 m"
  to disable.

# 1.40, 2014-05-15, fix selection collapse.

* s/selection.collapse()/selection.collapseToEnd().  The former now throws an
  exception in Chrome if called with no arguments, which breaks our attempts
  to block local selection when vt mouse is enabled.

# 1.39, 2014-05-14, Add 'pass-meta-v' preference.

* Add 'pass-meta-v' preference so Mac users can decide between Meta-V and
  Meta-Shift-V for paste.

# 1.38, 2014-05-13, Add 'ctrl-c-copy' preference.

* Add a 'ctrl-c-copy' preference.  When this is set to false, the default
  setting, Ctrl-C will always send ^C while Ctrl-Shift-C will copy if there is
  an active selection and send ^C if not.

  When 'ctrl-c-copy' set to true the meaning of the shift key is reversed.

  On the open web, the only reliable cross-browser configuration is with
  ctrl-c-copy set to true, as this allows the browser's built-in Ctrl-C handler
  to do its job.  Embedders can call term.getPrefs().changeDefault(
  'ctrl-c-copy', true) to adjust the default preference value in these
  situations.

# 1.37, 2014-04-29, Fix double-paste, add IE compatibility.

* Fix double-paste issue introduced in 1.36.
* First round of IE compatibility fixes.

# 1.36, 2014-04-28, Plumb ssh-agent, firefox, and wss-relay telemetry

* Add first round of Firefox compatibility fixes.
* Add telemetry data for wss-based relay connections.
* Update --config=google.
* Add ssh-agent plumbing.
* Remote lib_fs.js dependency.

# 1.35, 2014-03-25, Add enable-bold-as-bright preference.

* Adds a preference to control whether or not the bold attribute from ESC
  "[ ... m" sequences also triggers bright colors.  Preference is on by default
  to match the behavior of xterm (and previous versions of hterm).  Switch it
  off to enable bold font face in non-bright colors.  This is especially useful
  if you've overidden your 16 color palette to something other than the
  typical 8-dark/8-bright scheme.

# 1.34, 2014-03-14, Add ctrl-plus-minus-zero-zoom preference.

* In the default state (true) hterm works the same as before.  If set to
  false, ctrl-shift-plus/minus/zero controls zoom, and ctrl-minus sends ^_.

# 1.32, 2014-03-04, Disable local selection in all mouse reporting modes.

* Previously we allowed "local" selection (that which happens by default in
  Chrome) to stay enabled for mouse mode 1001 (report mouseup/down only).  This
  caused a few issues.  I didn't realize at the time that emacs used this
  mouseup/down positions to set an active region, which conflicts with the
  local selection.  You tend wind up with a confusing partial overlap of the two
  selections.  Additionally, with copy-on-select enabled, the mouseup event
  was consumed by the terminal and never sent to the host.

  This change disables local selection when we're in mode 1001.  Local selection
  was disabled in mode 1002, report mousedown/up/movement, which is preferred
  by vi.

  Our "mouse-cell-motion-trick" was all about allowing local selection in mode
  1002, so that's been removed too.  I doubt this preference was widely used.

  The change adds the ability to use alt-click to override the current mouse
  state, so that you can make a local selection even while in mode 1001/1002.
  Alt was chosen as its the only modifier key which can't be sent with a
  mouse event, though if you're depending on alt === meta, you'll lose
  the ability to send meta-mouse sequences.  If your local window manager
  already maps alt-click to something, then you can add any other modifier in
  addition to alt (say, alt-ctrl-mousedown) to defeat your existing binding.

# 1.31, 2014-03-04, Add svg based zoom detection.

* Re-implement zoom detection in terms of the currentScale property of svg
  elements.  This requires the svg element to be in the topmost document,
  or at least not in the "about:blank" document that the scrollport creates
  so it may not be perfect, but it's better than nothing.

# 1.30, 2014-03-04, Even better recursive "copy" fix.

* BUG=chromium:340699: Auto copy doesn't work.
  Now I see why the "select bags" aren't enough.  Even for the simplest case
  where we're copying an on-screen selection we need to use
  Terminal.prototype.copySelectionToClipboard to handle copy of wrapped lines.
  This fix reverts the changes from 1.28 and 1.29 in favor of just scheduling
  the copy on a timeout, which defeats the recursive copy blocker.
* Revert "Scrolling Speedups" change (which never got a distinct hterm version
  number).  This caused issues with selections scrolled out of the visible area.

# 1.29, 2014-02-14, Better recursive "copy" fix.

* BUG=chromium:340699: Auto copy doesn't work.
  AFAICT, the e.clipboardData.setData call wasn't actually doing anything.  The
  scrollport's "select bags" were doing the right thing though, so we have that
  going for us.  It's likely that the recursive "copy" was required in older
  versions of Chrome, but it doesn't seem to be necessary anymore.
* Fix the "Selection Copied" message from OSC 52 based copies.

# 1.28, 2014-02-13, Fix recursive "copy".

* BUG=chromium:340699: Auto copy doesn't work.
  Use e.clipboardData.setData, rather than causing a recursive
  document.execCommand("copy").

# 1.27, 2014-01-28, Add fullwidth support.

* Teaches hterm about the difference between halfwidth and fullwidth characters.

# 1.26, 2014-01-16, Add 'user-css' preference.

* Add a 'user-css' preference, which will load a user-defined css file (by url)
  into the terminal document.  This could be used to load a web font, or to
  style the terminal in perverse ways.

# 1.25, 2014-01-08, Fix DECSET 1002-while-mousedown.

* Fix an issue where DECSET 1002 failed if received while a mouse button was
  down.
* Add option to swap Ctrl-V/Ctrl-Shift-V.

# 1.24, 2013-12-10, Fix cursor height regression.

* Fix cursor sizing regression.  syncCursorPosition_ is now only about the
  position of the cursor, restyleCursor_ now sets cursor width, in addition to
  height and cursor shape related stuff.  Call restyleCursor_ from onResize_.

# 1.23, 2013-11-25, Prevent overlay focus, fix timeout tracking.

* Prevent the terminal overlay (hterm.Terminal.prototype.showOverlay) from
  taking focus if it happens to get clicked.
* Fix the overlay timeout tracking to fix cases where showOverlay is called
  again before the previous overlay has timed out.

# 1.22, 2013-11-25, Fix full-screen scroll region fix.

* hterm 1.19 attempted to ignore full-screen scroll regions, but the patch
  got the variable names wrong.  This fixes them.

# 1.21, 2013-10-31, Clear line-overflow whenever we insert characters.

* BUG=266128, Clear line-overflow state when inserting text.  This keeps
  us from accidentally re-using the overflow state of text that was already
  visible on the line.

# 1.20, 2013-10-31, Ignore ECH/EL in the presence of a cursor overflow.

* BUG=232390, Ignore erase-characters and erase-in-line escapes when the cursor
  has overflowed the terminal width.  This deviates from xterm, but matches
  gnome-terminal and other modern emulators.

# 1.19, 2013-10-30, Ignore full-screen vt scroll regions.

* BUG=266197, If the host attempts to set the VT scroll region to be the entire
  terminal height, we remove the scroll region entirely.  This lets full-screen
  apps overflow into the local scrollback buffer, which makes screen and tmux
  much more pleasant to use.

# 1.18, 2013-10-29, Implement Cursor shape change sequences.

* Implement cursor shape changes via DECSCUSR.
* Implement cursor shape changes via OSC 50 CursorShape (as described in
  http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Change_cursor_shape_in_different_modes.)
* Don't blink the cursor when the terminal is unfocused.

# 1.17, 2013-07-26, Double-click to select url-ish.

* On double-click, expand the text selection to make it easy to select URLs
  or other interesting substrings.

# 1.16, 2013-07-25, More fix newline regression.

* 1.15 got the treatment of the areas above/below the scroll region wrong.

# 1.15, 2013-07-25, Fix newline regression.

* getVTScrollBottom returns the row count if there is no vt scroll region in
  effect, need to read the vtScrollBottom_ property directly instead.

# 1.14, 2013-07-19, Fix newline in VT Scroll Region, packaged app fix.

* BUG=chromium:223140, Terminal viewer doesn't handle horizontally split curses
  application correctly.
* Fix the hterm.windowType detection to not barf when hterm is used in a
  Chrome packaged app.

# 1.13, 2013-07-17, Disable zoom warning on newer Chrome builds.

* New builds of Chrome removed document.width/height, so we're not able to use
  them to detect the zoom factor.  Disabled zoom detection when these properties
  are missing until we have a better solution.
* Fix libdot/changelog/(version|date) resources.
* Fix jscompiler errors.
* Stop printing "CSI K", "CSI ? J", and "ESC #" sequences with bad params.
* Shell script changes to pacify BSD.

# 1.12, 2013-06-24, Fix zoom warning.

* Fix the browser-zoom detection so we show the zoom warning again.

# 1.11, 2013-06-20, Add 'send-encoding'/'receive-encoding' preferences.

* Splits 'character-encoding' into two preferences so send and receive
  encodings can be set independently.
* Refactor Terminal.keyboard.onKeyDown_ to allow Ctrl+Alt+(printable) key
  combinations.
* Fix regression in Terminal..onPaste_.

# 1.10, 2013-06-20, Add 'character-encoding' preference.

* Adds a 'character-encoding' preference which can be set to 'utf-8' (default)
  or 'raw'.  When set to 'utf-8' hterm's behavior is unchanged from previous
  versions.  When set to 'raw', hterm will not attempt to decode input or
  encode output.

# 1.9, 2013-06-19, Fix issues with shift-key and CSI sequences.

* Clear e.shiftKey in hterm_keyboard_keymap.js' sh() function so that
  hterm_keyboard.js doesn't apply its own shift key munging.

# 1.8, 2013-05-31, overscroll fix

* BUG=chromium:245700: Call preventDefault on mousewheel events that we've
  handled.

# 1.7, 2013-05-31, Fix onTerminalResize, dec12 pref

* Pass width and height in io.onTerminalResize again, which regressed in the
  previous commit.
* BUG=245120: Add 'enable-dec12' preference, off by default, which allows the
  host to control the cursor blink state via DEC private mode 12.

# 1.6, 2013-05-24, Track terminal size on the io object.

* This installs a default onTerminalResize handler on the hterm.Terminal.IO
  object that records the most recent terminal size as io.columnCount and
  io.rowCount.  This gives consumers synchronous access to these values without
  having to wire up the event handler themselves.

# 1.5, 2013-04-18, Pass shift-ctrl-L

* BUG=chromium:233008, PASS shift-ctrl-L (CrOS screen lock combo)

# 1.4, 2013-04-05, wipeContents fix

* BUG=chromium:226819, Handle clearing screen when not scrolled to bottom

# 1.3, 2013-04-04, Keyboard fixes

* BUG=chromium:174410, Fix to allow Alt-Backspace to send Meta-Backspace
* BUG=chromium:226752, Don't trap media keys (e.g. Mute) by default.

# 1.2, 2013-03-19, Fix bell regression.

* Fix bug that made terminal bell only ring once.

# 1.1, 2013-03-13, Grab bag of fixes.

* Fix base64 encoding of the bell audio.
* Break out of a parseUntilStringTerminator_ if an embedded ESC is
  found (other than the one that may appear as part of a 7-bit ST),
  or if the sequence has been going on for too long (measured by the
  wall clock).
* BUG=chromium:191050, Map Chrome OS top-row keys to function keys.
* BUG=chromum-os:30792, beeps accumulate - leads to non stop beeping
* BUG=chromum-os:35288, scroll-on-output doesn't appear to work
* BUG=chromum-os:39645, Application keypad doesn't work properly

# 1.0, 2013-03-06, Initial split from Secure Shell codebase.

* Move nassh related files out into ../nassh/.
* Add hterm_resources.concat.
* Add bin/export.sh and related concat/ lists.
