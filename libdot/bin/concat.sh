usage: ./bin/concat.sh -i FILE [-o FILE] [-f]

This script concatenates a list of files into a single file.  The list of files
is supplied via text file, using the -i|--input_from argument.  The filenames
can be relative to the working directory or located in a directory listed in
LIBDOT_SEARCH_PATH.  Absolute paths also work, but should be avoided when the
input file is intended to be used by others.

If the -f|--forever argument is provided, then the script will monitor the
list of input files and recreate the output when it detects a change.

The environment variable LIBDOT_SEARCH_PATH can be used to define a search
path.  It's consulted when resolving input files, and lets you specify relative
paths in the input file without imposing a parent directory structure.  Multiple
paths can be separated by the colon character.

There are a few directives that can be specified in the input file.  They are...

  @include FILE

  This can be used to include an additional list of files.  It's useful when
  you want to include a list of files specified by a separate project, or
  any time you want to compose lists of dependencies.

  The included FILE must be relative to the LIBDOT_SEARCH_PATH.

  If an included file specifies a file that is already part of the result it
  will not be duplicated.

  When an included file is being processed this script will change the current
  directory to the LIBDOT_SEARCH_PATH entry where the FILE was found.  This
  is to make certain that any scripts executed by an included @resource
  directive happen relative to a known location.

  @resource NAME TYPE SOURCE

    NAME - The resource NAME is that name that you'd use to fetch the resource
    with lib.resource.get(name)

    TYPE - If the resource type is 'raw' then the resource will be included
    without any munging.  Otherwise, the resource will be wrapped in a
    JavaScript string. If you specify the type as a valid mimetype then you'll
    be able to get the resource as a 'data:' url easily from
    lib.resource.getDataUrl(...).

    SOURCE - When specified as '< FILENAME' it is interpreted as a file from
    the LIBDOT_SEARCH_PATH search path.  When specified as '\$ shell command'
    then the output of the shell command is used as the value of the resource.

  This includes a resource in the output.  A resource can be a file on disk or
  the output of a shell command.  Resources are output as JavaScript strings by
  default but can also be the raw file contents or script output, which is
  useful when you want to include a JSON resource.

  The resource directive depends on libdot/js/lib_resource.js, but the
  dependency is not automatically injected.  It's up to your input file to
  include it.

  @echo DATA

  Echo's a static string to the output file.
